**Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Test Case 1: Passive Voice to Active Voice

**Before**:
```
The decision was made by the committee to postpone the meeting.
The report will be reviewed by the team next week.
```

**Expected After** (applying Rule 10):
```
The committee decided to postpone the meeting.
The team will review the report next week.
```

**Principles Applied**: Active voice (Rule 10)
**Impact**: More direct, clearer responsibility

---

### Test Case 2: Omitting Needless Words

**Before**:
```
In my opinion, I think that there is no doubt but that this is a subject
which needs to be discussed at this point in time.
```

**Expected After** (applying Rule 13):
```
We must discuss this now.
```

**Principles Applied**: Omit needless words (Rule 13)
**Impact**: 78% word reduction, clearer meaning

---

### Test Case 3: Specific vs. Vague Language

**Before**:
```
The weather conditions were unfavorable for outdoor activities, so the
event was postponed due to circumstances beyond our control.
```

**Expected After** (applying Rule 12):
```
Heavy rain forced us to postpone the event.
```

**Principles Applied**: Use specific language (Rule 12), Active voice (Rule 10)
**Impact**: Concrete details, 52% word reduction

---

### Test Case 4: Positive Form

**Before**:
```
He was not very often on time. He did not have much confidence in the
plan. The results were not important.
```

**Expected After** (applying Rule 11):
```
He usually came late. He distrusted the plan. The results were trivial.
```

**Principles Applied**: Positive form (Rule 11)
**Impact**: More definite, clearer statements

---

### Test Case 5: Combined Transformation (Email Example)

**Before** (88 words):
```
I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that there has been a delay
in the completion of the project that we have been working on. The reason
for this delay is due to the fact that there have been some unexpected
technical difficulties that have arisen. We are currently working on
resolving these issues and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of
the situation. We will keep you updated as things progress.
```

**Expected After** (28 words):
```
The project is delayed due to unexpected technical difficulties. We are
working to resolve these issues quickly and will update you on our progress.
```

**Principles Applied**:
- Rule 10: Active voice ("We are working" instead of passive constructions)
- Rule 13: Omit needless words (68% reduction)
- Rule 11: Positive form (what IS happening, not what isn't)
- Rule 12: Specific language (named the problem directly)

**Impact**: 68% shorter, more professional, clearer
