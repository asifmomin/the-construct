Complete reference of all 18 rules with examples and explanations.

## Part I: Elementary Rules of Usage (Grammar & Punctuation)

### Rule 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's

**The Rule**: Whatever the final consonant, add 's to form the possessive singular.

**Examples**:
- Charles's friend
- Burns's poems
- the witch's malice
- the lens's power

**Exceptions**:
- Ancient proper names: Achilles' heel, Moses' laws
- Jesus' teachings
- For conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake

**Pronominal possessives** (no apostrophe):
- hers, its, theirs, yours, oneself

---

### Rule 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

**The Rule**: Use the serial comma (Oxford comma) consistently.

**Examples**:
- red, white, and blue
- gold, silver, or copper
- He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.

**Exception**:
- Business firm names: Brown, Shipley & Co.

---

### Rule 3: Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas

**The Rule**: Material that interrupts the flow must be set off by BOTH commas.

**Correct**:
- The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.
- He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile.

**Incorrect**:
- ❌ Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday.
- ❌ My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health.

**Always parenthetic**:
- Years in dates: "April 6, 1917"
- Days: "Monday, November 11, 1918"
- Abbreviations: etc., jr.
- Non-restrictive relative clauses

**Non-restrictive vs. Restrictive**:
- Non-restrictive (commas): "The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more interested."
- Restrictive (no commas): "The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place."

---

### Rule 4: Place a comma before a conjunction introducing a coordinate clause

**The Rule**: When independent clauses are joined by a conjunction, use a comma before the conjunction.

**Examples**:
- The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.
- The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.

**Conjunctions requiring comma**:
- and, but, for, or, nor, yet, so
- as (meaning "because")
- while (meaning "and at the same time")

**Exception**: When the subject is the same and expressed only once:
- With "but": "I have heard his arguments, but am still unconvinced."
- With "and" (if relation is close): "He has had several years' experience and is thoroughly competent."

---

### Rule 5: Do not join independent clauses by a comma

**The Rule**: Use a semicolon, not a comma, to join independent clauses without a conjunction.

**Incorrect**:
- ❌ Stevenson's romances are entertaining, they are full of exciting adventures.
- ❌ It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.

**Correct options**:

**Option 1 - Semicolon**:
- Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures.
- It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.

**Option 2 - Period**:
- Stevenson's romances are entertaining. They are full of exciting adventures.
- It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark.

**Option 3 - Conjunction**:
- Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures.
- It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark.

**With adverbial connectors**, use semicolon:
- The roads were impassable; therefore, we turned back.
- She studied hard; however, she failed the exam.

**Exceptions** (comma is permissible):
- Very short, parallel clauses: "Man proposes, God disposes."
- Colloquial expressions (informal only): "I hardly knew him, he was so changed."

---

### Rule 6: Do not break sentences in two

**The Rule**: Do not use periods for commas.

**Incorrect**:
- ❌ I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York.
- ❌ He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world.

**Correct**:
- I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago, coming home from Liverpool to New York.
- He was an interesting talker, a man who had traveled all over the world.

**Exception**: Emphatic fragments (use sparingly):
- Again and again he called out. No reply.

---

### Rule 7: A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject

**The Rule**: The word that the participial phrase modifies must be the subject of the sentence.

**Incorrect**:
- ❌ Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.
  (Implies the woman was walking)
- ❌ On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.
  (Friends didn't arrive; he did)
- ❌ Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me.
  (The task wasn't young)

**Correct**:
- He saw a woman accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.
- When he arrived in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.
- Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.

**Humorous errors**:
- ❌ Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap.
- ❌ Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve.

## Part II: Elementary Principles of Composition

### Rule 8: Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic

**The Rule**: Subdivide your subject into topics, each made the subject of a paragraph.

**Purpose**:
- Aids the reader
- Signals progression of thought
- Creates visual breaks for comprehension

**Single paragraph appropriate for**:
- Brief descriptions
- Brief summaries
- Single incidents
- Outlines of action
- Single ideas

**Exceptions**:
- Transition sentences
- Textbooks with many brief topics
- Each speech in dialogue is its own paragraph

---

### Rule 9: As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence, end it in conformity with the beginning

**The Rule**: Structure paragraphs for maximum clarity and impact.

**Standard structure**:
(a) Topic sentence at or near the beginning
(b) Succeeding sentences explain/establish/develop
(c) Final sentence emphasizes topic or states consequence

**Methods of development**:
- Restate in other forms
- Define terms
- Deny the contrary
- Give illustrations
- Provide specific instances
- Offer proofs
- Show implications
- Reveal consequences

**Avoid**:
- Ending with digression
- Ending with unimportant detail

---

### Rule 10: Use the active voice

**The Rule**: The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive.

**Active vs. Passive**:
- Active: "I shall always remember my first visit to Boston."
- Passive: "My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me."

**Why active is better**:
- More direct
- More bold
- More concise
- Clearer responsibility

**When passive is appropriate**:
- Actor is unknown: "The house was burgled."
- Actor is unimportant: "Mistakes were made."
- Focus is on object: "The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today."

**Avoid double passive**:
- ❌ "Gold was not allowed to be exported."
- ✓ "It was forbidden to export gold."

**Activate weak constructions**:
| Passive/Weak | Active/Strong |
|--------------|---------------|
| There were trees along the road | Trees lined the road |
| The sound of a guitar could be heard | A guitar hummed sleepily |
| There were a great number of dead leaves | Dead leaves covered the ground |

---

### Rule 11: Put statements in positive form

**The Rule**: Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, non-committal language.

**Negative to Positive**:
| Negative | Positive |
|----------|----------|
| He was not very often on time | He usually came late |
| He did not think that studying Latin was much use | He thought the study of Latin useless |
| not honest | dishonest |
| not important | trifling |
| did not remember | forgot |
| did not pay any attention to | ignored |

**When NOT works well**:
- Denial: "Not charity, but simple justice."
- Antithesis: "Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more."
- Emphatic negatives: "The sun never sets upon the British flag."

**Problem with weak negatives**:
- Readers want to know what IS, not just what ISN'T
- Negative statements are often indefinite
- Positive form is usually more concise

---

### Rule 12: Use definite, specific, concrete language

**The Rule**: Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

**Vague to Specific**:
| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| A period of unfavorable weather set in | It rained every day for a week |
| He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward | He grinned as he pocketed the coin |
| There is general agreement among those who have enjoyed the experience that surf-riding is productive of great exhilaration | All who have tried surf-riding agree that it is most exhilarating |

**Why specificity matters**:
- Creates mental pictures
- Holds reader attention
- Makes writing memorable
- Demonstrates clear thinking
- Reduces effort for reader

**Herbert Spencer's principle**:
"As we do not think in generals, but in particulars—as whenever any class of things is referred to, we represent it to ourselves by calling to mind individual members of it, it follows that when an abstract word is used, the hearer or reader has to choose, from his stock of images, one or more by which he may figure to himself the genus mentioned."

**Example transformation**:
| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous, the regulations of their penal code will be severe | In proportion as men delight in battles, bull-fights, and combats of gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack |

---

### Rule 13: Omit needless words

**The Rule**: Vigorous writing is concise. Every word must tell.

**Principle**: "A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."

**Common violations**:
| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | doubtless, no doubt |
| used for fuel purposes | used for fuel |
| he is a man who | he |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| this is a subject which | this subject |
| His story is a strange one | His story is strange |

**"The fact that" - Eliminate always**:
| With "the fact that" | Without |
|---------------------|---------|
| owing to the fact that | because, since |
| in spite of the fact that | although, though |
| call your attention to the fact that | remind you, notify you |
| I was unaware of the fact that | I did not know |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure |
| the fact that I had arrived | my arrival |

**Superfluous relative pronouns**:
| With | Without |
|------|---------|
| His brother, who is a member of the same firm | His brother, a member of the same firm |
| Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle | Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle |

**Combine related statements**:
| Multi-sentence (51 words) | Combined (26 words) |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true. The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed Duncan as king. | Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place. |

---

### Rule 14: Avoid a succession of loose sentences

**The Rule**: Vary sentence structure to prevent monotony.

**Problem pattern** - Repetitive coordinate clauses:
"The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental music. The former showed himself to be an artist of the first rank, while the latter proved itself fully deserving of its high reputation..."

**Solutions**:
- Simple sentences
- Sentences of two clauses joined by semicolon
- Periodic sentences
- Sentences with three clauses
- Vary connectives beyond "and," "but," "so"

---

### Rule 15: Express coordinate ideas in similar form

**The Rule**: Parallel ideas should be parallel in form (parallel construction).

**Why it matters**: Likeness of form helps readers recognize likeness of content and function.

**Examples**:
| Non-parallel | Parallel |
|--------------|----------|
| Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed | Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method |
| The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese | The French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese |

**Correlative expressions** must be followed by same construction:
| Incorrect | Correct |
|-----------|---------|
| It was both a long ceremony and very tedious | The ceremony was both long and tedious |
| A time not for words, but action | A time not for words, but for action |
| Either you must grant his request or incur his ill will | You must either grant his request or incur his ill will |

---

### Rule 16: Keep related words together

**The Rule**: Word position shows thought relationship.

**Subject and verb**:
- ❌ "Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description"
- ✓ "In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description"

**Relative pronouns**:
- ❌ "There was a look in his eye that boded mischief"
- ✓ "In his eye was a look that boded mischief"

**Modifiers**:
| Incorrect | Correct |
|-----------|---------|
| All the members were not present | Not all the members were present |
| He only found two mistakes | He found only two mistakes |
| Major Joyce will give a lecture on Tuesday evening in Bailey Hall, to which the public is invited, on "My Experiences in Mesopotamia" at eight P.M. | On Tuesday evening at eight P.M., Major R. E. Joyce will give in Bailey Hall a lecture on "My Experiences in Mesopotamia." The public is invited. |

---

### Rule 17: In summaries, keep to one tense

**The Rule**: Choose present or past tense for your summary and maintain it throughout.

**Present tense** (preferred for summaries):
- "Friar Lawrence learns of the non-delivery of the letter."
- Antecedent action uses perfect: "has been compelled"

**Past tense** (acceptable):
- "Friar Lawrence learned of the non-delivery"
- Antecedent action uses past perfect: "had been compelled"

**Avoid**: Shifting between tenses suggests uncertainty

**Past in indirect discourse remains unchanged**:
- "The Friar confesses that it was he who married them."

---

### Rule 18: Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end

**The Rule**: The most prominent position is the end; second is the beginning.

**Examples**:
| Weak ending | Emphatic ending |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways | Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude |
| This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness | Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors |

**Periodic sentences** gain force from delaying the main statement:
"Four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus, one of the Italian mariners whom the decline of their own republics had put at the service of the world and of adventure, seeking for Spain a westward passage to the Indies as a set-off against the achievements of Portuguese discoverers, lighted on America."

**Principle applies to**:
- Words in a sentence
- Sentences in a paragraph
- Paragraphs in a composition
