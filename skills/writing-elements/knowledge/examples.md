Real-world transformations demonstrating Elements of Style principles in action.

## The Classic Four-Sentence Transformation

### Before (51 words)
```
There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground. The sound
of a guitar somewhere in the house could be heard. It was not long before
he was very sorry that he had said what he had. The reason that he left
college was that his health became impaired.
```

### After (23 words)
