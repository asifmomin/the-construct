# Core Principles - The Elements of Style

This document summarizes the foundational principles from William Strunk Jr.'s *The Elements of Style* (1918).

## Philosophy

Clear writing requires:
- **Clarity**: Readers should never have to re-read for meaning
- **Conciseness**: Respect the reader's time; every word must earn its place
- **Vigor**: Strong, direct expression compels attention
- **Precision**: Say exactly what you mean, no more, no less

## The Big Four Transformative Principles

### 1. Use the Active Voice (Rule 10)

**Principle**: Make subjects act rather than be acted upon.

**Why it matters**:
- More direct and forceful
- More concise
- Creates clearer mental images
- Assigns responsibility clearly

**Pattern**:
- Passive: "The ball was thrown by John."
- Active: "John threw the ball."

### 2. Omit Needless Words (Rule 13)

**Principle**: Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words.

**Why it matters**:
- Respects reader's time
- Increases impact per word
- Forces clear thinking
- Prevents reader fatigue

**Common needless phrases**:
- "the fact that" → eliminate or rephrase
- "in my opinion, I think" → "I think" (opinion is implied)
- "he is a man who" → "he"
- "in a hasty manner" → "hastily"

### 3. Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language (Rule 12)

**Principle**: Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

**Why it matters**:
- Creates vivid mental images
- Engages the reader's senses
- Makes writing memorable
- Demonstrates clear thinking

**Pattern**:
- Vague: "A period of unfavorable weather set in."
- Specific: "It rained every day for a week."

### 4. Put Statements in Positive Form (Rule 11)

**Principle**: Make definite assertions. Tell what IS, not just what is NOT.

**Why it matters**:
- More concise
- More definite
- Easier to understand
- More forceful

**Pattern**:
- Negative: "He was not very often on time."
- Positive: "He usually came late."

## Supporting Principles

### Paragraph Structure (Rules 8-9)

**One paragraph = one topic**:
- Each paragraph should develop a single idea
- Beginning a new paragraph signals a new step

**Lead with topic sentence**:
- State the main idea early
- Develop it in the middle
- End with emphasis or consequence

### Sentence Construction (Rules 14-18)

**Vary structure (Rule 14)**:
- Avoid monotonous succession of similar sentences
- Mix simple, compound, and periodic sentences
- Create rhythm and maintain interest

**Parallel construction (Rule 15)**:
- Express similar ideas in similar form
- Helps readers recognize relationships
- Creates pleasing rhythm

**Keep related words together (Rule 16)**:
- Word position shows thought relationship
- "He only found two" vs. "He found only two"

**Emphatic placement (Rule 18)**:
- Place important ideas at sentence end
- Beginning is second-most emphatic
- Middle is weakest position

### Grammar Fundamentals (Rules 1-7)

**Possessive formation (Rule 1)**:
- Add 's to singular nouns: Charles's, Burns's
- Exceptions: ancient names, Jesus'

**Serial comma (Rule 2)**:
- Use comma after each term except the last
- "red, white, and blue"

**Parenthetic expressions (Rule 3)**:
- Enclose between commas (or comma and period)
- Must use both commas or neither

**Coordinate clauses (Rule 4)**:
- Place comma before conjunction joining independent clauses
- "It was late, and we were tired."

**Independent clauses (Rule 5)**:
- Don't join with comma alone
- Use semicolon or period
- Exception: very short, parallel clauses

**Sentence fragments (Rule 6)**:
- Don't break sentences in two
- Don't use periods for commas

**Participial phrases (Rule 7)**:
- Must refer to grammatical subject
- "Walking slowly, he saw the house" ✓
- "Walking slowly, the house came into view" ✗

## Words and Expressions to Avoid

### Needless Constructions

**"The fact that"** - Almost always unnecessary:
- "owing to the fact that" → "because"
- "in spite of the fact that" → "although"
- "the fact that he arrived" → "his arrival"

**"There is/are" constructions** - Often weaker than active verbs:
- "There were trees along the road" → "Trees lined the road"
- "There is no doubt that" → "Doubtless"

**Redundant modifiers**:
- "he is a man who" → "he"
- "this is a subject which" → "this subject"
- "in a hasty manner" → "hastily"

### Commonly Misused Words

**Fewer vs. Less**:
- Fewer: countable items ("fewer people")
- Less: quantities ("less water")

**That vs. Which**:
- That: restrictive clauses (essential information)
- Which: non-restrictive clauses (additional information)

**While**:
- Use literally for "during the time that"
- Don't substitute for "and," "but," or "although"

## Application Strategy

### When Reviewing Writing

1. **First pass - Big Four**:
   - Mark passive voice → convert to active
   - Identify needless words → eliminate
   - Find vague language → make specific
   - Spot negative statements → make positive

2. **Second pass - Structure**:
   - Check paragraph unity
   - Verify topic sentences
   - Test emphatic placement
   - Improve word positioning

3. **Third pass - Polish**:
   - Grammar and punctuation
   - Parallel construction
   - Sentence variety
   - Final conciseness check

### When Writing Fresh

1. **Draft freely** - Get ideas down
2. **Apply Big Four** - Transform weak constructions
3. **Structure** - Organize paragraphs, add topic sentences
4. **Polish** - Grammar, variety, emphasis
5. **Cut ruthlessly** - Eliminate everything that doesn't earn its place

## Exceptions and Flexibility

**When to bend the rules**:
- Passive voice: When the actor is unknown or unimportant
- Wordiness: When rhythm or emphasis requires it
- Abstract language: When dealing with abstract concepts
- Negative form: When creating antithesis or emphasis

**Context matters**:
- Legal writing: May require passive voice
- Poetry: May intentionally break rules
- Technical writing: May need abstract terms
- Dialogue: May use fragments and casual speech

## The Ultimate Test

Good writing should be:
- **Understood on first reading** - Clarity
- **Impossible to shorten without loss** - Conciseness
- **Memorable and engaging** - Vigor
- **Exactly what you meant to say** - Precision

## Progressive Mastery

### Beginner Focus
- Rule 10: Active voice
- Rule 13: Omit needless words
- Rule 5: Don't use comma to join independent clauses

### Intermediate Focus
- Rule 12: Specific language
- Rule 11: Positive form
- Rule 16: Related words together
- Rule 18: Emphatic placement

### Advanced Mastery
- Rule 9: Topic sentences
- Rule 14: Sentence variety
- Rule 15: Parallel construction
- All common mistakes

## Quick Diagnostic

Ask of any sentence:
1. Is the voice active? (Rule 10)
2. Can I cut any words? (Rule 13)
3. Can I be more specific? (Rule 12)
4. Should I state this positively? (Rule 11)
5. Are related words together? (Rule 16)
6. Is the emphatic word at the end? (Rule 18)

If you answer "no" to any question, revise accordingly.
